For Instagram, we will use a fork of the snscrape package, use:
pip install -U git+https://github.com/0bmay/snscrape@insta_fix
Download the snscrape package, which is a snscrape package specifically for Instagram fix

Make sure ins.py and instagram.py are in the same folder, and only instagram.py needs to be run when running.

If there are any problems during runtime, please let me know
